This project shouldn't have taken long, but I tried to make it as good as I could.

I know there are still a lot of things that I can make improvement upon, but I think it's time to learn more.

Doing this project, helped me learn a lot too. I learnt about objects in array, grid, flexbox and much more. I already had an understanding of them, but using them on a project helped me understand them better.

I will comeback to this project to add localstorage support on it.

This project has left me hungry to learn more, and improve myself as much as I can.
